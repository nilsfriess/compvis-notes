\section{Shallow and Deep Learning}
Example: Pixel classification/ semantic segmentation. State of the art
before 2000:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Take image
\item Compute features
\item Construct decision rule \textbf{by hand} (\eg select foreground
  and background)
\item Mark pixels according to decision rule
\end{enumerate}

State of the art 2000--2012:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Take image
\item Put into filter bank that produced lots of images that summarise
  local contexts (\ie produce features)
\item Take all of the images and classify using a shallow classifier
  (Support vector machine, random forest)
\end{enumerate}
The second step is done by the user, \ie the features are selected by
hand. After 2012: Deep learning.  Take the image and repeatedly apply
a set of filters + non-liearity (the ``layers''). At the very end use
a shallow classifier (in NN: perceptron/ logistic regression). The
layers are trained jointly!
